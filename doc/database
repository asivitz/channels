Message Tree Structure
----------------------
A separate table encodes the tree
Each row represents a branch

Each row contains:
Root Message ID: The message ID that we branch from
Parent branch ID: The branch ID of the Root Message ID

Each row in the message table has a branch ID

To get the root message on all branches:
Get all branches, read root message Id

To get the latest message on a branch:
Get all messages with a branchid
Find the latest one

To get all messages for a particular branch showing branch points:
Get all messages with a branchid
Get all branches with a parent branch id of branchid
Get the root message Id's of those branches

To make a branch from a message:
Add a row to branch table with the root message id and parent branch id
